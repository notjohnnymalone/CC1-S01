CC1-S01 Part One Questions

1)The difference is that the iterative code is much longer and more repetative in a way.
The recursive code is more condensed and... 'simple'.

2)In the recursive program it runs the same code each time with the length changing as you go.
The iterative program runs different code almost everytime except where it can do the same moves with a
	different length. It will only run the certain parts as long as the set conditions are met,
	not just run one repeatedly until the main condition is met. recursion also calls itself.

3)Iteration uses a bunch of loops until each condition is met.
Recursion runs until the main condition is met, but is called in itself during.

CC1-S01 Part Two

1)Recursion would be good for when you have a highly repetative task and when you can
end up shortening the code

2)If you have a very large output that could crash your computer, when you don't have repetative tasks,
or when you just don't want to....

3)Calculating a factorial, or when you draw a symmetrical or complex geotric shape with turtles.
